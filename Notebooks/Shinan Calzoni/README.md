## 9/20/24 Discussion with Machine Shop

First meeting with Gregg. Discussed project idea as well as tentative timeline for project. Plan to provide part dimensions as well as a basic schematic so that the machine shop can produce a chassis.

## 10/11/24 Circuit Schematic First Draft

Basic circuit schematic designed, need to do power requirement calculations and investigate further into IC chips of choice and other details. Note that other students were running into issues with the LM117 voltage regulator for voltage drops exceeding a particular threshold due to overheating.
